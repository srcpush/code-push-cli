## 1. Introduction

Welcome! This guide will help you migrate your Over-the-Air (OTA) updates from Appcenter to Source Push.
With Source Push's Command Line Interface (CLI), you can easily push updates directly to your users' devices
without needing to go through app stores.

**What You'll Learn:**

- How to install the Source Push CLI
- Migrating your existing OTA updates from Appcenter
- Setting up and managing your applications and deployments in Source Push
- Updating your React Native app to use Source Push for OTA updates

Let’s get started!

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following (depends on your platform and preferences):

- **Developer Tools Installed:**
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - npm or Yarn
  - npx
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **Permissions:**
  - Ability to install npm packages globally.

- **Source Push Account:**
  - Sign up at [Source Push](https://srcpush.com/) using GitHub or Google for authentication.

- **(If Migrating) Appcenter Access:**
  - Ensure you have access to your existing Appcenter account and its CLI.

### 2.1 Installing Required Tools

You manage most of CodePush's functionality using the App Center CLI.
If you had one installed, you can update it to the latest version by running the following command:

```shell
   npm update -g appcenter
```

or install it from scratch by running the following command:

```shell
   npm install -g appcenter@latest
```

Upon installation or update, you can check the version of the App Center CLI by running the following command:

```shell
   appcenter -h
```

which will display the version of the App Center CLI you have installed with available commands.

```shell
$ appcenter -h 

Visual Studio App Center helps you build, test, distribute, and monitor mobile apps.
Version 3.0.3

    setup-autocomplete             Setup tab completion for your shell 
```

### 2.2 Setting Up Source Push CLI

Similarly to Appcenter Source Push manages the most of CodePush's functionality using CLI.

To install it run the following command:

**Install Source Push CLI:**

```shell
   npm install -g @srcpush/code-push-cli
```

**Update Source Push CLI to the Latest Version:**

```shell
   npm update -g @srcpush/code-push-cli
```

Upon installation or update, you can check the version of the Source Push CLI and the list of available commands by running the following command:

**Verify Installation:**

```shell
   srcpush -h
```

which will display the version of the Source Push CLI you have installed with available commands.

```shell
srcpush -h
 ____                 ____            _     
|  _ \ _____   _____ |  _ \ _   _ ___| |__  
| |_) / _ \ \ / / _ \| |_) | | | / __| '_ \

## 3. Migrating from Appcenter to Source Push

You need to execute steps in this section if you have been using Appcenter for OTA updates and wish to migrate to Source Push.

If you did not use Appcenter OTA updates before and just wish to apply
OTA on top of Source Push for your app feel free to skip this section and go to section [4](#4-setting-up-srcpush-from-scratch).

### 3.1 Logging In

Execute the following command to login to Appcenter CLI using provider of your choice (GitHub, Facebook, Microsoft, Google):

```shell
  appcenter login
```

Similarly, in a separate window login to Source Push CLI using the following command:

```shell
  srcpush login
```

### 3.2 Migrating Applications and Deployments

**1. List Your Appcenter Apps:**

```shell
  appcenter apps list
```

Example Output:

```shell
  johndoe/rn2_android
  johndoe/rn2_ios
```

For given guide we assume that `johndoe/rn2_android` is the React Native application for Android and `johndoe/rn2_ios`
is the React Native application for iOS.

You can check target OS of the app using command `appcenter apps show -a <app name here>`.

**Android:**

```shell
appcenter apps show -a johndoe/rn2_android
App Secret:            6c3cb412-105f-422f-b795-af53d0b36a5f
Description:           
Display Name:          rn2_android
Name:                  rn2_android
OS:                    Android
Platform:              React-Native
Release Type:          Alpha
Owner ID:              a1265e53-0599-4340-8003-7c40f0caff38
Owner Display Name:    John Doe
Owner Email:           johndoe@joghdoe.com
Owner Name:            johndoe
Azure Subscription ID: 
```

**iOS:**

```shell
appcenter apps show -a johndoe/rn2_ios    
App Secret:            37d1dce7-a991-4ccc-8a0c-1ff8ed00f45d
Description:           
Display Name:          rn2_ios
Name:                  rn2_ios
OS:                    iOS
Platform:              React-Native
Release Type:          
Owner ID:              a2265e53-0699-4340-8003-7c41f0caff39
Owner Display Name:    John Doe
Owner Email:           johndoe@johndoe.com
Owner Name:            johndoe
Azure Subscription ID: 
```

**2. Create Corresponding Source Push Apps:**

Remove the username prefix when creating apps in Source Push.

```shell
  srcpush app add rn2_ios
  srcpush app add rn2_android
```

Example Output:

```shell
Successfully added the "rn2_ios" app, along with the following default deployments:
┌────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name       │ Deployment Key                         │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Production │ Z7v_81HyATiWlqZjvQFyu9GIicXAVJHvdy5W-g │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Staging    │ PjAEsKZUdAytb5Rq3Kb6yHVfn-H3VJHvdy5W-g │
└────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```shell
Successfully added the "rn2_android" app, along with the following default deployments:
┌────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name       │ Deployment Key                         │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Production │ EVGdS0GR4Sus584cdyZ95wmwI405VJHvdy5W-g │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Staging    │ pkCafa80S-ji3y6Xey6zVcEju9AHVJHvdy5W-g │
└────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**3. Replicate Deployments:**

List Appcenter deployments:

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list -k -a johndoe/rn2_ios
```

Add the same deployments in Source Push with identical keys

```shell
srcpush deployment add rn2_ios appcenter_Staging -k <Staging_Key>
srcpush deployment add rn2_ios appcenter_Production -k <Production_Key>
```

Repeat for Android

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list -k -a johndoe/rn2_android
srcpush deployment add rn2_android appcenter_Staging -k <Staging_Key>
srcpush deployment add rn2_android appcenter_Production -k <Production_Key>
```

Repeat for all other deployment you have in Appcenter and wish to continue to use in Source Push.

## 4. Setting Up Source Push from Scratch

If you're new to Source Push and want to set up OTA updates for your app, follow these steps.

### 4.1 Logging In

```shell
  srcpush login
```

### 4.2 Creating Applications

#### For iOS

```shell
srcpush app add myAmazingApp_ios
```

#### For Android

```shell
srcpush app add myAmazingApp_android
```

This will create your app along with default Staging and Production deployments.

### 4.3 Creating Deployments

If you need more deployments (e.g., Development, Testing), use:

```shell
srcpush deployment add myAmazingApp_android Development
```

List All Deployments:

```shell
srcpush deployment ls myAmazingApp_android -k
```

## 5. Updating Your React Native App

After setting up Source Push, update your React Native application to point to the Source Push server.

### 5.1 iOS Configuration

1. **Open `Info.plist`:** Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>Your_Deployment_Key</string>
<key>CodePushServerURL</key>
<string>https://api.srcpush.com</string>
```

An example for `myAmazingApp_ios` app and `Staging` deployment:

```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>vUOFPtZfOlhXHPEDE3nkf7nP6lJ4VJHvdy5W-g</string>
<key>CodePushServerURL</key>
<string>https://api.srcpush.com</string>
```

2. **Dynamic Deployment Key (Optional):** To switch deployments dynamically in your JavaScript code, use [Code-Push options](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/api-js.md#CodePushOptions)

### 5.2 Android Configuration

1. Open `strings.xml`: Add the following entries:

```xml
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">Your_Deployment_Key</string>
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushServerUrl">https://api.srcpush.com</string>
```

An example `myAmazingApp_android` app and `Staging` deployment `strings.xml`:

```xml
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">kbAXqSrgEfLPcuvU3Fe0SCqX5HpOVJHvdy5W-g</string>
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushServerUrl">https://api.srcpush.com</string>
```

2. **Dynamic Deployment Key (Optional):** To switch deployments dynamically in your JavaScript code, use [Code-Push options](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/api-js.md#CodePushOptions)

## 6. Releasing Updates

Once your app is configured, you can release updates to your users.

### 6.1 For iOS

```shell
srcpush release-react rn2_ios ios -d Staging
```

**What Happens:**

- Bundles your JavaScript code.
- Uploads the bundle and assets to Source Push.
- Releases the update to the Staging deployment of rn2_ios.

**Success Message:**

```shell
...
Successfully released an update containing the "/var/folders/my/lwrczz7503g5911_wf51jsvm0000gp/T/CodePush" directory to the "Staging" deployment of the "rn2_ios" app.
```

### 6.2 For Android

```shell
srcpush release-react rn2_android android -d appcenter-Staging
```

**What Happens:**

- Bundles your JavaScript code.
- Uploads the bundle and assets to Source Push.
- Releases the update to the appcenter-Staging deployment of rn2_android.

**Success Message:**

```shell
...
Successfully released an update containing the "/var/folders/my/lwrczz7503g5911_wf51jsvm0000gp/T/CodePush" directory to the "appcenter-Staging" deployment of the "rn2_android" app.
```
